# 3D T-Shirt Designer with  AI Integration

This project showcases a dynamic website that combines the power of ThreeJS for 3D graphics with artificial intelligence. It's designed to provide an immersive and interactive experience for users while also demonstrating the integration of image generating AI technology.

## Key Features

1. **T-Shirt Design:** Customize t-shirt designs with a color picker.
2. **File Upload:** Personalize t-shirts by uploading images.
3. **AI Prompt:** Generate t-shirt designs through AI prompts using DALLE AI.

## Usage

To explore and interact with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
 and install the required dependencies
    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    npm install
3.  Create an `.env` file under the `/server/` directory and include your OpenAI API key for image generation. Here's an example of what your `.env` file should contain:

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
4. Running the Project:
    
    a.  Start the backend server from the `/server/` folder:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```

    b. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server from the `/client/` folder:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```
Now, the project should be up and running locally, allowing you to explore the ThreeJS-powered 3D graphics and AI integration in action.

## Conclusion

# 3D T-shirt Designer with  AI Integration

## Introduction

This project showcases a dynamic *React* website that combines the power of *ThreeJS* for 3D graphics with artificial intelligence. It's designed to provide an immersive and interactive experience for users while also demonstrating the integration of image generating AI technology.

Cutting-edge technologies and features used to create a dynamic and engaging web experience:

  *`ThreeJS`   `React Three Fiber`    `TailwindCSS`  `Framer Motion`*    

## Key Features

1. Customize t-shirt designs with a color picker.
2. Personalize t-shirts by uploading images.
3. Generate t-shirt designs through AI prompts using DALLE AI.
4. Download an image of resulting T-shirt.

## Usage
